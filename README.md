# Plugin Mod

**Plugin Mod** is a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) mod that allows you to add miscellaneous weapons, artifacts, blocks, and apples to your world. It is developed for creative and storytelling players who want to make their Minecraft worlds more in-depth and unique. I made this mod solely to pair well with CustomNPC+¬†[Here](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/customnpc-plus) and allow creators to use these items such as the weapons with NPCs to make them more diverse. All the items are majority¬†Creative Only¬†and all aspects of this mod can be¬†toggled via the¬†generated config! I hope you all enjoy it!
