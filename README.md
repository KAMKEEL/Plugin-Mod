### Description

1.7.10 Minecraft Mod created by Kam (M.C Username) / @KAMKEEL for RPG/Storytelling Servers.

This mod adds various weapons and aestetic items to minecraft 1.7.10 for the sole purpose of allowing RPG Servers to rename and use these items in various forms of story telling. Some of these items do have custom effects and abilities like allowing for reversed orientation of daggers or throwable kunai.

I give permission to use this code for practice, expermentation or modpacks as long as no claim is being made that it is created by someone other than the original author.

##### Extra Information
###### I do not take credit for majority of the artifact textures used within this mod as they are borrowed from Hypixel Skyblock Texture Packs with fair usage.
